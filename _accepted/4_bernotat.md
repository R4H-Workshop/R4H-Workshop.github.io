title: Asch Meets HRI - Human Conformity to Robot Groups
subtitle: Jasmin Bernotat, Doreen Jirak, Eduardo Benitez Sandoval, Francisco Cruz 
excerpt: "We present a research outline that aims at investigating group dynamics and peer pressure in the context of industrial robots. Our research plan was motivated by the fact the industrial robots became already an integral part of human-robot co-working. Despite this, however, industrial robots were sparsely integrated into research on robot credibility, group dynamics, and potential users’ tendency to follow a robot’s indication. Therefore, we will transfer the classic Asch experiment (see [1]) into HRI with industrial robots. We will test to what extent participants’ follow a robot’s response when confronted with a group vs. individual industrial robots compared to when confronted with human peers who obviously give a doubtful response. We are interested in highlighting the effects of group size, perceived robot credibility, psychological stress, and peer pressure in the context of industrial robots. With the results of this research, we hope to highlight group dynamics that might underlie HRI in industrial settings in which numerous robots already work closely together with humans in shared environments."

**Abstract**: 	We present a research outline that aims at investigating group dynamics and peer pressure in the context of industrial robots. Our research plan was motivated by the fact the industrial robots became already an integral part of human-robot co-working. Despite this, however, industrial robots were sparsely integrated into research on robot credibility, group dynamics, and potential users’ tendency to follow a robot’s indication. Therefore, we will transfer the classic Asch experiment (see [1]) into HRI with industrial robots. We will test to what extent participants’ follow a robot’s response when confronted with a group vs. individual industrial robots compared to when confronted with human peers who obviously give a doubtful response. We are interested in highlighting the effects of group size, perceived robot credibility, psychological stress, and peer pressure in the context of industrial robots. With the results of this research, we hope to highlight group dynamics that might underlie HRI in industrial settings in which numerous robots already work closely together with humans in shared environments.
