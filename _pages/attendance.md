### Let's stay in touch!

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The First edition of the GROUND workshop was great, so we plan to continue the discussion in future editions!

This form is to gather researchers interested in the topic so that we can advance all together toward more natural and ergonomic group-robot interactions.

Just leave your email here if you want to stay in touch.
Thank you again for participating in the GROUND workshop!
