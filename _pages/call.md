We are pleased to invite abstract submissions for the workshop “Robots for Humans: Designing Social Robots That Spark Children’s Creativity”, which will be held in conjunction with the ICSR + Art 2026 Conference, in London, UK.

The third edition of the RfH workshop aims to discuss the current trends in using robots to increase, empower, and sustain children’s creativity and artistic skills. Creativity is a fundamental component of children’s cognitive, emotional, and social development and is widely regarded as a key capability that should be nurtured from an early age. Canonical literature frames creativity as the ability to generate ideas or artifacts that are both novel and useful, yet research increasingly points to a concerning decline in children’s creative abilities during the school years. This “creativity crisis” highlights the need for environments and tools that can actively sustain children’s imaginative thinking and expressive potential. 

Recent research shows that social robots can act as supportive partners in nurturing and enhancing children’s creativity. Studies in child–robot interaction demonstrate that embodied agents can scaffold creative processes through divergent thinking prompts, adaptive feedback, emotional attunement, and multimodal interaction. In parallel, the field of robotic art has shown how machines can participate in open-ended processes of artistic emergence, revealing how robotic platforms can become sources of creativity. 

However, existing work in Robot–Art and Human–Robot Co-Creation remains fragmented and has paid limited attention to the specific opportunities and risks that arise when the creators are children. Finally, emerging evidence with neurodivergent populations suggests that personalized and inclusive robot behaviors can lower creative barriers, foster agency, and support the development of diverse creative styles over time. These findings highlight the strong potential of using robots to support children’s creativity. This applies both to neurodivergent children, who may benefit from creative activities that are structured yet expressive, and to neurotypical children, for whom creative engagement is closely tied to well-being and a sense of autonomy. B

uilding on these insights, we argue that creativity not only shapes how children interact with robots but also how they may co-design a robot’s roles, behaviors, and artistic contributions within co-creative systems. We **invite contributions** from researchers and practitioners in HRI, AI, psychology, design, arts, education, healthcare, and other related fields. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

We particularly welcome interdisciplinary and speculative approaches that challenge existing paradigms and propose new directions for socially intelligent robotics.

We invite authors to submit an extended abstract (up to 4 pages, excluding references) in PDF format, outlining their research, ideas, or ongoing work relevant to the workshop themes. Submissions will be lightly peer-reviewed by the organizers based on relevance, originality, and potential for discussion. Please, refer to the Main conference's template ([https://icsr2026.uk/calls/#RegularPaper](https://icsr2026.uk/calls/#RegularPaper)).

</p>

<!--Please submit your abstract in PDF format via **[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/cfp/RfH2025)**. -->

<p style="text-align: justify;">

Accepted abstracts will be presented during the workshop as short talks or posters, depending on the number and type of submissions. We aim to foster a lively, inclusive, and interdisciplinary dialogue.

## Registration
* Don't forget to register before the conference **[registration link](https://avi2024.dibris.unige.it/conference/registration)**.

## Submission Procedure

**Submission format**: max 6 pages (excluded references).

Please submit your contribution on **[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=r4h)**, using the predefined **[CEUR template](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip)** (an **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gwhxnqcghhdt)** page for LaTeX users is also available).

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The submitted contribution must be written in <b>English</b> and do not need to be anonymized (single-blind review process). A panel of experts from relevant fileds will be asked to review the contributions, selecting the most relevant, novel, original and high-quality ones to be included in the workshop program. Authors of accepted submissions will be invited to give an <b>oral presentation</b> of their work. Also, they will be offered the option of having their papers uploaded to a workshop-specific archive in an open-access repository (e.g., arXiv). The accepted papers will be published in the workshop’s proceedings on CEUR Workshop Proceedings (http://ceur-ws.org/), indexed by Scopus. Depending on the workshop impact and participation, the organizers may also consider proposing a Special Issue to a Journal to collect broader follow-up papers.
