## Submission Procedure

**Submission format**: max 6 pages (excluded references).

Please submit your contribution on **[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=r4h)**, using the predefined **[CEUR template](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip)** (an **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gwhxnqcghhdt)** page for LaTeX users is also available).

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The submitted contribution must be written in <b>English</b> and do not need to be anonymized (single-blind review process). A panel of experts from relevant fileds will be asked to review the contributions, selecting the most relevant, novel, original and high-quality ones to be included in the workshop program. Authors of accepted submissions will be invited to give an <b>oral presentation</b> of their work. Also, they will be offered the option of having their papers uploaded to a workshop-specific archive in an open-access repository (e.g., arXiv). The accepted papers will be published in the workshop’s proceedings on CEUR Workshop Proceedings (http://ceur-ws.org/), indexed by Scopus. Depending on the workshop impact and participation, the organizers may also consider proposing a Special Issue to a Journal to collect broader follow-up papers.
