                <div class="postcard__preview-txt"><b>Of Robots and Stereotypes: The Case of Gender in Humanoid Robots.</b> <br>Humanoid robots are designed for <i>humans</i> by <i>humans</i> and look like <i>humans</i>. As such, they end up condensing many biases humans hold towards their co-specifics, especially concerning gender. Designers might bring their views of gender into the design of humanoid bodies, behaviors, and roles. Similarly, users of robots might project their views of gender onto humanoid robots. In this talk, I will give an overview of the topic of gendering robots and the stereotypes and biases it might bring about. I will go through five studies I have performed on this topic and discuss and summarize the different facets of the issue. </div>
