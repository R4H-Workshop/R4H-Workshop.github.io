Her research is focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for design, especially Human-machine (AI) co-creativity. It addresses the intersection of human-computer interaction, brain-computer interface (BCI), creativity, AI design method and AI artworks. By investigating the relationship between human and machine, she developed a human-in-the-loop AI method, which is called symbiotic creativity. This is an interactive system that can communicate with humans throughout the creation process and is facilitated by a range of human-AI interaction tools.
