                <div class="postcard__preview-txt">Dr. Eleonora Zedda (she/her) is a National Research Council (CNR) post-doctoral researcher. Her research revolves around human-robot interaction (HRI), specifically focusing on social robotics. Her primary research focuses on connecting users and robots by developing robot personalities and adapting robot behaviours to meet users' needs. Her approach aims to make human-robot interaction more intuitive and enjoyable for users by designing robots' behaviour that can understand and adapt to users' states. </div>
