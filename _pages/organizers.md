Her research revolves around human-robot interaction (HRI), specifically focusing on social robotics. Her primary research focuses on connecting users and robots by developing robot personalities and adapting robot behaviours to meet users' needs. Her approach aims to make human-robot interaction more intuitive and enjoyable for users by designing robots' behaviour that can understand and adapt to users' states. </div>

Her research is focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for design, especially Human-machine (AI) co-creativity. It addresses the intersection of human-computer interaction, brain-computer interface (BCI), creativity, AI design method and AI artworks. By investigating the relationship between human and machine, she developed a human-in-the-loop AI method, which is called symbiotic creativity. This is an interactive system that can communicate with humans throughout the creation process and is facilitated by a range of human-AI interaction tools. Pan received her PhD from the Dyson School of Design Engineering and Data Science Institute from Imperial College London.</div>
