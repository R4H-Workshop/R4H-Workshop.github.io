                <div class="postcard__preview-txt">With a product design background and a PhD in Design Creativity, her research and educational focus is on the support of designers in creative problem solving. Currently, she is exploring the role of inspiration sources and creativity in service and product design and at the collaborative level. She is also interested in how inspirational information triggers co-evolution of the problem and solution space, creativity and innovation, inspiration and information, random stimuli, curiosity, surprise, design thinking, design methods, design methodology and visual thinking. She is the coordinator of the course SPD Media, which aims to support students from the Strategic Product Design master in the development of their expressive skills. In this project-based course, students work individually to explore and improve a set of media skills, which could include different types of sketching, prototyping, digital design, animation, video, among others. Therefore, this course aims to bring expressiveness to SPD-related knowledge, in order to improve how their work is presented and communicated to others. </div>

                <div class="postcard__preview-txt">Elizabeth Jochum is Director of Robotics and Automation at RA Capital. Prior to joining RA, she was an associate professor at Aalborg University and headed the RELATE Research Laboratory for Art and Technology. Her research uses the visual and performing arts as catalysts for re-thinking how we design and implement robots and other assistive technologies across society. From industrial robots to exoskeletons, her work focuses on developing creative, value-sensitive and human-centered approaches to developing and implementing robots to ensure the technologies we build address the real needs of people. Jochum’s work involves transdisciplinary collaboration in human-robot interaction, health, and engineering. Her research focuses on critical and creative approaches to health and wellbeing, with an emphasis on dance and disability, and advocate principles of STEAM (STEM + Art) to arrive at more integrated research approaches. She co-founded the ROCA Robot Culture and Aesthetics group at University of Copenhagen, lectured on the Erasmus Mundus Media Art Cultures faculty, and is a member of AAU Robotics.</div>
