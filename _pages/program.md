                <div class="postcard__preview-txt">With a product design background and a PhD in Design Creativity, her research and educational focus is on the support of designers in creative problem solving. Currently, she is exploring the role of inspiration sources and creativity in service and product design and at the collaborative level. She is also interested in how inspirational information triggers co-evolution of the problem and solution space, creativity and innovation, inspiration and information, random stimuli, curiosity, surprise, design thinking, design methods, design methodology and visual thinking. She is the coordinator of the course SPD Media, which aims to support students from the Strategic Product Design master in the development of their expressive skills. In this project-based course, students work individually to explore and improve a set of media skills, which could include different types of sketching, prototyping, digital design, animation, video, among others. Therefore, this course aims to bring expressiveness to SPD-related knowledge, in order to improve how their work is presented and communicated to others. </div>

                <div class="postcard__preview-txt">Dawid Kasprowicz is a research assistant at c:o/re where he coordinates the fellow program. From 2005 to 2012 he studied media studies and philosophy at the Ruhr-University in Bochum and at the Université du Littoral Côte d’Opale in Dunkerque. He graduated with a master thesis on Bernard Stieglers concept of psychopower. From 2013 to 2016 he was a PhD student at the Institute for Advanced Studies on Media Cultures of Computer Simulation in Lüneburg. In his dissertation, which was published in 2019 (Nomos), he developed a history of knowledge about the concept of immersion. From 2018 till 2021, he has been a postdoc at the chair for Theory of Science and Technology at the RWTH Aachen University where he was also the Head of the Computer Science Studies Lab (CSS-Lab). In autumn 2021 he was a DAAD-Visiting Scholar in the Department of Philosophy at the University Rouen (Natalie Depraz). In his habilitation he develops a phenomenological approach to the philosophy of computational sciences based on the concept of experience and a theoretical intersection of phenomenology of technology and philosophy of science. His main research fields include theory and history of embodiment, phenomenology, human-robot-Interaction, philosophy of computer simulation.  </div>

                <div class="postcard__preview-txt">Elizabeth Jochum is Director of Robotics and Automation at RA Capital. Prior to joining RA, she was an associate professor at Aalborg University and headed the RELATE Research Laboratory for Art and Technology. Her research uses the visual and performing arts as catalysts for re-thinking how we design and implement robots and other assistive technologies across society. From industrial robots to exoskeletons, her work focuses on developing creative, value-sensitive and human-centered approaches to developing and implementing robots to ensure the technologies we build address the real needs of people. Jochum’s work involves transdisciplinary collaboration in human-robot interaction, health, and engineering. Her research focuses on critical and creative approaches to health and wellbeing, with an emphasis on dance and disability, and advocate principles of STEAM (STEM + Art) to arrive at more integrated research approaches. She co-founded the ROCA Robot Culture and Aesthetics group at University of Copenhagen, lectured on the Erasmus Mundus Media Art Cultures faculty, and is a member of AAU Robotics.</div>
