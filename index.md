# Workshop Highlights


The 1st edition of the Robots for Humans Workshop will he held at the <a href="https://avi2024.dibris.unige.it/"><b>17th International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces</b></a>!

We invite researchers from both the Human-Computer (HCI) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) communities to participate at the R4H workshop to ...

### Workshop Theme & Topics of Interest

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The "Robots for Humans" (R4H) workshop bridges the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) communities. The workshop encourages methodological exchange and explores theoretical, technical and design solutions in robotics. Join us to explore the intricate bond between humans and robots for thoughtful HRI advancements.

Participants are invited to share <b>innovative strategies for exploring group-robot interactions</b>, with approaches focused on - but not limited to â€“ gamification, providing a fresh and insightful viewpoint to (1) using social robots for understanding group dynamics; (2) designing social agents able to interact with groups. Additionally, the discussion will involve the ethical implications of researching group dynamics, including potential negative outcomes such as biases toward group members.
</p>

Topics of interests include but are not limited to:
* HCI theories and methods and novel approaches applied to HRI, Cognitive Architectures for HRI.
* Concept papers on the role of technology and robots in empowering or challenging human well-being.
* Empirical studies for human empowerment with technology (e.g., SAR, Health care, educational context).
* Participatory design approaches for HRI applications (e.g., user-centred design for computer and robotic applications, human-centred, and interaction-based design)
* Research methods and challenges for different contexts (e.g., assistive and education) in the HRI field.
* Interaction with virtual or physical embodied agents, human factors and human-in-the-loop in HRI, group dynamics in HRI.
* Design relationship between humans and robots (multi-modal communication, robot personalities, gender robotics, empathy).
* Diversity, power dynamics, gender, racism, social stereotypes and vulnerable targets of users in HRI.
* Trust, acceptance and explainability in HRI; personalisation and end-user development of robot applications.
* Ethical issues (e.g. privacy, misuse and abusive interactions), social risks and fairness in HRI.

### Statement of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The workshop organizers are committed to creating an inclusive, diverse, and equitable environment for all attendees. We recognize and value the diversity of our attendees and understand that people have different needs and preferences. To accommodate the different time zones of attendees, the workshop will be held in a hybrid format and will be recorded for later viewing. To ensure that all attendees have reliable access to the internet, we will provide technical support and troubleshooting assistance as needed. We encourage attendees from underrepresented groups to submit their work and participate in the workshop. We are committed to creating an equitable and diverse environment, and we are open to suggestions on how to improve the workshop in terms of inclusion and accessibility.
