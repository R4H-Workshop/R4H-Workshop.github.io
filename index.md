### Workshop Theme & Topics of Interest

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In recent years, understanding how robots can be applied to empower different areas of society has become a key aspect of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). The concept of human empowerment applied to HRI refers to enhancing human capabilities, autonomy, and control through robots that act as supportive tools rather than replacements. This concept is particularly relevant in areas such as accessibility, learning, decision support, and user involvement in designing and customising robots. From this perspective, robots are no longer just technological artefacts but enablers that help individuals, groups, and industries overcome barriers and expand their capabilities. The workshop “Robots for Humans” (RfH) aims to bridge applicative and design perspectives on the challenges of integrating robots into society to pursue people’s empowerment. The aim is to establish research and design practices that identify where robots represent a pragmatic need, as well as what design practices can effectively achieve this goal.

### Statement of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The workshop organizers are committed to creating an inclusive, diverse, and equitable environment for all attendees. We recognize and value the diversity of our attendees and understand that people have different needs and preferences. To accommodate the different time zones of attendees, the workshop will be held in a hybrid format and will be recorded for later viewing. To ensure that all attendees have reliable access to the internet, we will provide technical support and troubleshooting assistance as needed. We encourage attendees from underrepresented groups to submit their work and participate in the workshop. We are committed to creating an equitable and diverse environment, and we are open to suggestions on how to improve the workshop in terms of inclusion and accessibility.
